Homework 3 - Palindromes, Inversions, and Gray Codes.


README:

This repository contains three Java programs: palindromecheck, GrayCode, and inversioncount
(easyinversioncount & fastinversioncount).

1. Palindrome Check

The first program, palindromecheck, checks if an input string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string
that reads the same forward and backward.

The program will prompt the user to input a string. It will then display whether the entered string is a palindrome or
not. To exit the program, type exit.

2. Inversion Count

    2.1 Easy Inversion Count
        easyinversioncount uses a naive approach, which has a time complexity of O(n^2).

        The program will display the number of inversions in the predefined array. To change the input array,
        edit the array variable in the main method of easyinversioncount.java and recompile.

    2.2 Fast Inversion Count
        fastinversioncount uses a divide and conquer algorithm (merge sort approach), which has a time complexity of
        O(n log n).

        The program will display the number of inversions in the predefined array. To change the input array,
        edit the array variable in the main method of fastinversioncount.java and recompile.


3. Gray Code and Klutzomaniacs

The second program, GrayCode, generates a Gray code sequence, Klutzomaniac actions, and Klutzomaniacs riding sequences
for a tricycle.

The program will display a table containing the generated Gray code, Klutzomaniacs riding sequences, and Klutzomaniac
actions. To change the Gray code order, edit the value of n in the main method of GrayCode.java and recompile.
